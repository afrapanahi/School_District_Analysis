# School_District_Analysis
In this project we used pandas to look at data from students in different schools. According to the data:
- 1. Public school receive slightly more budget than the charter schools
- 2. The average math score in charter schools slightly higher than public schools
- 3. The average reading scores almost the same
- 4. When broken down by grades, 9th, 10th and 11th graders in charter schools do better in math compared to public schools but the 12th graders in public shcools do slightly better than the charter schools. In reading scores, 11th graders in charter schools did better than the public schools.
